## Machine Learning Task 2: Support Ticket Classification & Prioritization

This repository contains my submission for **Machine Learning Task 2** under the **Future Interns Fellowship Program (2026)**.

---

### 🔍 Problem Statement
Customer support teams receive a large number of tickets daily. Manual categorization and prioritization leads to delays and inefficiencies.

This project uses **Machine Learning and NLP** to automatically:
- Classify support tickets into issue categories
- Assign priority levels (High / Medium / Low)

### 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorization

---

### ⚙️ Features Implemented
- Text cleaning and preprocessing
- TF-IDF based feature extraction
- Ticket category classification
- Ticket priority prediction
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, and recall

---

### 📊 Business Impact
- Faster ticket resolution
- Reduced backlog
- Better handling of urgent issues
- Improved customer satisfaction
